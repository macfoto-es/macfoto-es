        <h4>Couturier Juergen C. Hoerl</h4>
        <p class="mt-4">
Austrian fashion designer Juergen draws his inspiration from cultures and using his sharp engaging eye to find his inspiration around the world. Proposing my concept was an instant hit, why you might ask. While I was based in Vienna I did a lot of scouting on locations. The reason is simple, It was shot in his cultural environment the famous Naschmarkt. Not only did I use the Naschmarkt but his design studio as well, which is literally around the corner of the Naschmarkt. Because the locations were in the nearby vicinity, it made our day go easy and comfortable for Juergen and his models.  They apologized for the fact that my surname was long to get it in the design of the video…… I loved that because everybody calls me MAC anyway.
Olympus head office in Vienna sponsored me with the EM1 Mark II mirrorless camera bodies which are half the size and weight. 
The lenses 12-40 / F2.8  &  40-150 / 2.8  are fast and accurate in autofocus.
The effortless, intuitive interface, smooth zooming and the complete weight of the system are unmatched. I Used Canon 5d mark III as my backup body, which in most cases I never needed.
Olympus is built for professionals and I personally would recommend giving this camera a tryout for their outstanding performance.
I want to thank Olympus very much for their loyalty and support.

The importance of pitching is to maintain your level of creativeness and working in a precise order. 
For big clients like Mango or Zara demands precisional repetition photography, PRP for short.
The 3 key points of making sure that these clients are interested, is your eye for detail !! 
The clothing should be recognized in the design, details, and products of these brands.
Casting is very important to make your images look strong and feminine that will suit the concept.
Olga, a very experienced Model from Ukraine, was perfect for the shoot. 
She was kind considerate and very committed.
With our team we made my creative concept come to life.
Therefore I am grateful for my complete loving team to make this day wonderful and creative.
I would love to give tribute to Olympus cameras who sponsored me with their fantastic EM1 Mark II mirrorless camera
bodies and superb lenses.
Most shots I did with the 12-40 / F2.8  (24-70 equivalent 35mm). The fast accurate autofocus and smooth zooming are
outstanding.
What made me change my mind is the weight and an effortless interface. I Used Canon 5d mark III as my backup body.
My recommendation for professionals is to give Olympus a tryout for their outstanding performance.
